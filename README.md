# Pandemic
> Very simple demonstration of the spread of a virus

`Pandemic` uses the html5 Canvas element and Javascript to demonstrate how a virus spreads throught the population - in a very simplified way of course :). This project was created with a view to improving my skills as a developer.

# The Process 
> *People are represented by coloured circles*
* Blue = not infected
* Red = infected
* Green = recovered and immune
